    "English": "For Modders: Removes the AI-lighthouses, if they are owned by a human player, eg. by using the Ruin-on-Takeover Mod. The vanilla game does use the lighthouse GUIDs in many Quests and other stuff, without checking the owner, so it is better to never allow a human to control these specific GUIDs.",

    "German": "Für Modder: Entfernt KI-Leuchtürme, falls sie zb. durch einen Ruin-on-Takeover Mod oder sonst wie in den Besitz eines menschlichen Spielers geraten sind. Denn das vanilla Spiel nutzt diesen oft in Quests und prüft den Besitzer nicht, sodass es am Besten ist wenn der Mensch diese GUIDs niemals besitzt.",
